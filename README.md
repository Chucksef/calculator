This calculator website is the final development challenge in The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics course.
I intend this project to be finshed in the following stages, possibly adding interstitial commits as needed:

v 0.2 - Bare bones of CSS styling to make using application slightly less awful
v 0.3 - Number button / main readout functionality
v 0.4 - Operator Buttons / Equation Display (second display that shows the current equation to be run)
v 0.5 - Clear button functionality
v 0.6 - Equation evaluation (Equals button functionality)
v 0.7 - Equation validation
v 0.8 - Answer rounding/overflow

v 1.0 - working basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply and divide integers
v 1.1 - Decimal button functionality
v 1.2 - Backspace button functionality
v 1.3 - Intuitive and Attractive UI
v 1.5 - Keyboard support
