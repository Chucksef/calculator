This calculator website is the final development challenge in The Odin Project's JavaScript Basics course.
I intend this project to be finshed in the following stages, possibly adding interstitial commits as needed:

v 0.0 - Initial Commit
v 0.1 - HTML written and all elements present (though not at all attractive or intuitive)
v 0.2 - Bare bones of CSS styling to make using application slightly less awful
v 0.3 - Number button / main readout functionality
v 0.4 - Operator Buttons / Equation Display (second display that shows the current equation to be run)
v 0.5 - Clear button functionality
v 0.6 - Backspace button functionality
v 0.7 - Equation evaluation (Equals button functionality)
v 0.8 - Equation validation and Error Handling
v 1.0 - Answer rounding/readout overflow.
        Initial development complete. Works as user would expect (can add, subtract, multiply and divide integers).
-------------------------------------------------------------
v 1.1 - Decimal button functionality
v 1.3 - Intuitive and Attractive UI
v 1.4 - Extend backspace support to Equation readout
v 1.5 - Keyboard support
v 2.0 - Responsive Layout to support mobile
